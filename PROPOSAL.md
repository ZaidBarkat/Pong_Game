I want to use Cinder to create a game such as Brick Breaker. This would be done by creating rectangles that are changeable with a ball between them just like the game.

I decided to do this project because in High School, I was interested in Python over the summer and created a little game. basically, you would move a block and dodge other blocks.
So, I was thinking about the final project, and decided making another game would be the most interesting thing to do.

I'm hoping that by the first week, I am able to finish the implementation of the movement of the bottom rectangle, the ball velocity movement,
and the rectangles on the top. Then by the second week, I am hoping to make sure the game is working, and then create different shapes, more balls, and 
maybe another level. By the third week, I am going to try and add special abilities into the game, such as changing the background when a ball hits an item, or
changing the speed of the ball, maybe changing the rectangles to different shapes.

If I'm able to finish this project early, I would like to see if I could create a graph like the ideal gas project, where the graph would show the amount of times it has hit your rectangle, and the amount of rectangles left or something like that.
