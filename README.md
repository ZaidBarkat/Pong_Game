# Brick Breaker

Creation of the classic video game Brick Breaker, created through
Cinder. In this game, you control a rectangular platform, moving it in the
x direction only. This platform is used to hit a ball that moves with speed
in the x and y direction. The goal of the game is to hit this ball towards
bricks at the top of the screen. These bricks are rectangular and vanish
once the ball hits them. If you decide to use Computer Mode, the AI will
try to hit the balls for you, moving the player platform on its own. Once
about 3 to 4 bricks are hit, the balls will start increasing, causing the
game to get harder, but also giving you more chances to hit all the
bricks. Once all bricks are hit, you win the game! If you miss the balls,
you lose.
